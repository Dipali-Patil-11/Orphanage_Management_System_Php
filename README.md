# Orphanage Database Management System

This is a web oriented project on Orphanage Management System which keeps record of all the orphans. This is a simple project which uses PHP for connection and MySQL for storing records in database. I have also provided a feature to add a payment gateway to accept donations . 
The Orphanage Database Management System (ODMS) is a comprehensive, automated platform designed to manage the complex activities of orphanages efficiently. Orphanages serve an essential role in society by providing care, shelter, and education to children who are without families or guardians. However, managing such institutions involves many tasks that need to be performed regularly, including maintaining records of children, donors, sponsors, managing donations, and reporting on the financial contributions and usage. Without an automated system, these tasks become error-prone, inefficient, and time-consuming.
